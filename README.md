🐶 Project Description: Pet Sitting Website

🔍 Overview:

This project is a simple, single-page informational website for a fictional small business called Elms Pet Sitting. The site introduces the company, outlines the pet care services offered, displays pricing, and includes stylistic enhancements like parallax scrolling effects and a structured layout using semantic HTML.

🧑‍💼 Who It's For:
- Beginner web development students learning HTML and CSS layout structure.
- Individuals or students creating mock business websites for school projects or labs.
- Freelancers or pet care providers wanting to prototype a basic online presence for a pet-sitting service.

✨ Key Features:
- Responsive layout using <section> and <nav> for content structure and navigation.
- Parallax scrolling sections (via parallax_image class) for visual appeal.
- Navigation links that jump to different sections of the page (About, Services, Rates).
- Rates table with clearly formatted service pricing.
- Business branding with a logo image and contact details.
- Footer to reinforce branding and close the site cleanly.

💡 Concepts Demonstrated:
- Semantic HTML structure (header, nav, section, footer)
- Anchor linking for one-page navigation
- HTML tables for service pricing
- Image and link embedding
- External CSS file integration (csstemplate.css)
- Basic accessibility (alt text could be added for improved compliance)
